<span style="text-align: center">A Leeds-based developer specialising in .NET and .NET Core applications for business and enterprise.</span>

## Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you can often find me either sleeping, spending time with my cat, Marmalade, trying out a new recipe, or occassionally out walking or climbing somewhere.

Depending on how lucky you get, you might also fin me streaming games on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/mrshojy), although I can be very intermittent with that.

## Code

While primarily I work with the Microsoft stack of technologies, I am quite often seen wandering around outside of it, doing work that involves Objective-C, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, Angular, Firebase, and recently I've been trying to dust off some ReactJS too.
