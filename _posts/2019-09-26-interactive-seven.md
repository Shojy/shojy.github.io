Lets start with a little bit of history. A while back, I was working on a project for viewing party and status for the PC version of Final Fantasy 7, specifically with the idea of having that information appear in an overlay for streamers and content producers that played the game. This app was dubbed "Tseng", after one of the characters in the game. Tseng was the leader of a group called the Turks, that among other things, specialised in intel and spying - pretty similar to what my app is doing to the player's party!

Fast forward a bit, and I encounter another streamer who is taking the opposite approach - building interaction that allows twitch chat members to affect and influence the game, able to do things such as renaming characters, or changing equipment.

We both realise that each of these apps form two sides of the same gil, and agree to merge the applications. There are a few daughter-projects born of this, including a library to read and extract data and assets from the game files (Elena). All projects are available on GitHub
